# Assembly Data Structures with Advent of Code

This repository contains implementations of various data structures in x64 MASM Assembly, with an fun twist: using these data structures to solve puzzles from Advent of Code!

## Overview

### Advent of Code

Here are the specific puzzles I solve in this project:
- [**2021 Day 1: Sonar Sweep**](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1)
- [**2021 Day 6: Lanternfish**](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/6)

For more information, visit the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) website.

## Data Structures Implemented

- **Linked List**
- **Stack**
- **Queue**

Each data structure is implemented to work using dynamic memory allocation using the `malloc` and `free` functions. Pointer arithmetic is used to simulate structs representing each node in a data structure.
