# ASM Data Structures and Advent of Code

This repository contains implementations of various data structures in **x64 MASM Assembly**, with an fun twist: using these data structures to solve puzzles from **Advent of Code**!

## Overview

### Advent of Code Puzzles

Here are some specific puzzles I plan to solve in this project:
- [**2021 Day 6: Lanternfish**](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/6)
- [**2021 Day 10: Syntax Scoring**](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/10)
- [**2022 Day 5: Supply Stacks**](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/5)

For more information, visit the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) website.

## Data Structures Implemented

- **Linked Lists**
- **Stacks**
- **Queues**

Each data structure is implemented to work with dynamic memory allocation using the `malloc` and `free` functions. Pointer arithmetic is used to simulate structs representing each node in a data structure.
